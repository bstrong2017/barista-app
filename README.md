# Barista-app 
## COP4804 001 15089 Web Development course 

Barista app is a code path project made to help us develop our useState() functions, learn React form, import new files, and use constant and use state for variables together. The Barista app allows the user to test their knowledge of the Starbucks drink menu by allowing them to click either radio buttons or fill in blank textboxes. Using data from the imported drinks JSON, we can create logic to test whether the use answers or true or false. 

Objectives: 
[] React forms
[] UseState w/ constant variables 
[]Visual Changes w/ user input

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
